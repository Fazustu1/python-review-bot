# Python Review Bot

## Description
The function of this project was to automate the process of creating a fake Gmail account which would then go on to automatically rate a place on Google Maps with the selected number of stars. This is a failed project as is explained below.

## Installation
run 'python install -r requirements.txt'

## USAGE
Go through code and replace unspecified parameters to suit your function.

## IMPORTANT
This is a failed project since Google doesn't allow for the automated creation of Gmails, because of the requirement of having a phone number. Anyone can take this project and try to complete it.
